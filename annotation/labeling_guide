Instruction:
1) Run the main program in any directory.

2) After running we have a gui window, in the below of that window we have a option to load your directory which is containing the our images just select and load the images.

3) Lets look up on the top right side of this pop-up window we have classes option first select your class number then start labeling.

4) When labeling is done then, again look up below side under the loading options we also have taps for saving the labels and then go for the next image.

5) When we go on the next image then a directory containing our lables is created in the same directory in which we have our images.

6) And this tool is also created a text file name train.txt which contain address of images.

7) This code is copied from internet but we can edit it according to our applications. 

8) Converting to TensorFlow format
   After labelling the images, the labels can be read and converted to TFRecord using Python scripts available in Tensorflow, using tf.train.Example and tf.train.Features. Note: Yolo and TF share the same bounding box notations (normalised).
